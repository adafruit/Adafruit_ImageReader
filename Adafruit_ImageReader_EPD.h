/*!
   @brief  An optional adjunct to Adafruit_EPD that reads RGB BMP
           images (maybe others in the future) from a flash filesystem
           (SD card or SPI/QSPI flash). It's purposefully been made an
           entirely separate class (rather than part of SPITFT or GFX
           classes) so that Arduino code that uses GFX or SPITFT *without*
           image loading does not need to incur the RAM overhead and
           additional dependencies of the Adafruit_SPIFlash library by
           its mere inclusion. The syntaxes can therefore be a bit
           bizarre (passing display object as an argument), see examples
           for use.
